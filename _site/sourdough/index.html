    "title": "About",
    "body": "Who am I?: Though I’d love to attach this blog to my real life, it feels necessary for me to stay anonymous at this point in time, if only to allow myself a bit more freedom in my writing. To this end, I’ll go by mycorhizo, a name inspired by the rhizomatic mycelial connections branching out underneath our ecosystems, those which connect organisms to each other and direct resources toward those in need. I can say, however, that I’m a relatively young (just got a bachelor’s!) neuroscience student interested in math, pharmacology, and computer science, among other things. For the sake of being a well-rounded person, and appeasing the tortured artist in me, I really enjoy film/music, philosophy, and classic literature as well. At some point, I’ll likely post photography and music that I create in a separate section of the blog. Topics of Interest: I’ll most likely be writing a number of research proposals on various topics in psychopharmacology. The first of many is an exploratory analysis of nicotine addiction in adolescence, and proposed novel drug combinations for amelioration of the addiction itself, as well as symptoms of withdrawal. If you only came here for psychedelics, well, they’ll be in that paper. Aside from that, I have a reasonable desire to write about some philosophy of mind topics, namely the totally radical (/s) theories panpsychism, open individualism, and integrated information theory. You should expect to see some random essays on leftist ideology, music, film, and food, too. On The Name of this Blog:  “From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes” — Bertrand Russell, “Mysticism” I derived the name seeing snakes as a bit of a jab at myself. From the time I was in high school, I was highly interested in recreational drugs, but most often found myself seeing snakes, as it were, in the headspaces of these compounds. I’ve suffered from a ridiculously strong addiction to cannabis, as well as nicotine, and my drug use in adolescence and early adulthood coalesced into a very traumatized, dissociated, and cognitively impaired adult form. On the other hand, personal friends and enemies alike have experienced the total encompassing bliss of the loss of death anxiety, of depression cured with a hundred mics, of the remission of trauma and its grateful, permanent departure – all from the use of psychedelics and nootropic compounds, ranging from the oh-so-benign LSD all the way to IDRA-21 and strychnine. This dichotomy is existentially irrelevant but hedonically salient, something I want to make a habit of stressing in my work. Lastly, I think this passage from Russell speaks to a lot of the ignorance surrounding our perspectives on drug use. There isn’t a difference between societally-accepted alcohol use, and methamphetamine use, or LSD use. These substances are all simply small molecules that coincidentally interact with a cornucopia of electrodynamically favorable binding sites, and as such, the valence associated with use of them is best described by the phrase, “your mileage may vary. ” Friends of the Blog (whether they know it or not):  Gaige Clark (founder of qwerky science) – one of many friends whose own work and life story inspired me to pull my life together and create things again. We’ll likely collaborate on projects here and there.  Nervewing (founder of “why why why why why why why”) – an absolute genius whose study of research chemicals is truly inspiring.  Andrés Gómez Emilsson (co-founder of Qualia Research Institute) – made me believe in an approach to science and philosophy I dared not think exist, and inspired much of my logical reasoning and rhetoric.  Alex K. Chen (#1 on Quora for who knows how long) – credited for connecting me with some of the most influential people I’ve met in my adult life. Likely kickstarted my path to recovery from x,y,z awful events/practices/ideologies.  Chau Le Tran – A name I haven’t thought of in a long time. She connected me with Alex K. Chen, and invited me to a Facebook group chat revolving around discussion of psychedelics. She probably did this at the worst time for me to engage academically, but was nonetheless as or more important (solely on who-did-it-first basis) than Alex in connecting me with the right people.  Cosmo Guerini – One of the first friends I made at my first lab position, and sent me a blog post once encouraging me to start a blog over a year ago. "

    "body": "Bucharest’s history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in antiquity until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

    "body": "2020/10/30 - In the name of radical honesty, something I’ve only begun to bring into action (despite two years of pro-active work on it), I am writing this. I have lost quite a few years of my life to mental illness, something deep and disrupting, that removed my memory, my passion, my will. I am only beginning to recover, and as I look around, I cringe. I make new friends with similar interests, yet mine feel so undeveloped. So, I’m starting a blog. To create passion. To work on projects. To make something of myself, as I no longer wish to offload my life path on the fickle nature of academia and capitalism. This is a push for me. I often hold myself to the belief that recovery from mental illness is significantly more dependent on one’s ability to accept their present state, than to push for some symbiosis of their past and future selves. However, I don’t think that’s enough anymore. In recent years, I’ve become close to quite a few amazing people. (those who are direct influences to this blog are named in the About section) I’ve forgotten most of our conversations, still reeling from the haze of dissociation, but their influence on me has been profound. Meeting these people has made me remember with more clarity than ever before the person I used to be. Though I was disconnected from others as a child, I was curious. In my long struggle with disease, I have lost my curiosity. I have accepted my fate as one of sadness, pain (both emotional and physical), and suffering. In tandem, my exposure to the bourgeoisie for the first time in college showed me what the United States is incentivized to believe about me, and what I am expected to do. I won’t go into much detail here, but a brief synopsis is as follows:  “I am but a foundation. I must learn from those superior to me, in class, education, resources, etc. so that I may become one of them, so that my children may live truly free lives. ” In being a first-generation college student, this felt as a real as any scientific fact I readily gobbled down in my childhood. Its implications seethed into my daily life, and I lost my power in the wake of new awareness. It is difficult for me to elaborate further than this on how disease and new awareness shaped me into an altogether different personality — perhaps this is the opaque blanket trauma drapes over my memories, or perhaps I’ve simply been dulled by my recent experiences in life. Whatever the case may be, I’d now like to try to subvert these abstract notions I’ve laid out. Not with ignorant bliss, but with a valiant rejection of the applied Sisyphean reality that threatens to consume my life. So, I’m starting this blog. I’m also trying to do a lot of other things. I’ve been learning about mycology (which I’ll be writing about here) and applying to jobs and graduate school (which I don’t feel ready for, but hopefully I will by next fall). I don’t plan to write many posts like this, but maybe once in a while. I’d like my more technical work to speak for itself, and to figure out how to weave my life into my science and art. If you’re reading this and aren’t enjoying it, please try one of my less personal entries before writing off the blog. And to the rest of you, do savor the time, and connect with me. I’d like to build a community around these ideas, and have that community connect and meld with others in whatever organic way arises. "
