<p>Though I’d love to attach this blog to my real life, it feels necessary for me to stay anonymous at this point in time, if only to allow myself a bit more freedom in my writing. To this end, I’ll go by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mycorhizo</code>, a name inspired by the rhizomatic mycelial connections branching out underneath our ecosystems, those which connect organisms to each other and direct resources toward those in need.</p>

<p>I can say, however, that I’m a relatively young (just got a bachelor’s!) neuroscience student interested in math, pharmacology, and computer science, among other things. For the sake of being a well-rounded person, and appeasing the tortured artist in me, I really enjoy film/music, philosophy, and classic literature as well. At some point, I’ll likely post photography and music that I create in a separate section of the blog.</p>

<h4 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h4>

<p>I’ll most likely be writing a number of research proposals on various topics in psychopharmacology. The first of many is an exploratory analysis of nicotine addiction in adolescence, and proposed novel drug combinations for amelioration of the addiction itself, as well as symptoms of withdrawal. If you only came here for psychedelics, well, they’ll be in that paper.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I have a reasonable desire to write about some philosophy of mind topics, namely the <strong><em>totally radical</em></strong> (/s) theories panpsychism, open individualism, and integrated information theory.</p>

<p>You should expect to see some random essays on leftist ideology, music, film, and food, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes” — Bertrand Russell, <a href="https://scepsis.net/eng/articles/id_4.php">“Mysticism”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I derived the name <em>seeing snakes</em> as a bit of a jab at myself. From the time I was in high school, I was highly interested in recreational drugs, but most often found myself seeing snakes, as it were, in the headspaces of these compounds. I’ve suffered from a ridiculously strong addiction to cannabis, as well as nicotine, and my drug use in adolescence and early adulthood coalesced into a very traumatized, dissociated, and cognitively impaired adult form.</p>

<p>On the other hand, personal friends and enemies alike have experienced the total encompassing bliss of the loss of death anxiety, of depression cured with a hundred mics, of the remission of trauma and its grateful, permanent departure – all from the use of psychedelics and nootropic compounds, ranging from the oh-so-benign LSD all the way to IDRA-21 and strychnine.</p>

<p>This dichotomy is existentially irrelevant but hedonically salient, something I want to make a habit of stressing in my work. Lastly, I think this passage from <em>Russell</em> speaks to a lot of the ignorance surrounding our perspectives on drug use. There isn’t a difference between societally-accepted alcohol use, and methamphetamine use, or LSD use. These substances are all simply small molecules that coincidentally interact with a cornucopia of electrodynamically favorable binding sites, and as such, the valence associated with use of them is best described by the phrase, “your mileage may vary.”</p>

<h4 id="friends-of-the-blog-whether-they-know-it-or-not">Friends of the Blog (whether they know it or not)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Gaige Clark (founder of <a href="https://mad.science.blog">qwerky science</a>) – one of many friends whose own work and life story inspired me to pull my life together and create things again. We’ll likely collaborate on projects here and there.</li>
  <li>Nervewing (founder of <a href="https://nervewing.blogspot.com">“why why why why why why why”</a>) – an absolute genius whose study of research chemicals is truly inspiring.</li>
  <li>Andrés Gómez Emilsson (co-founder of <a href="https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org/">Qualia Research Institute</a>) – made me believe in an approach to science and philosophy I dared not think exist, and inspired much of my logical reasoning and rhetoric.</li>
  <li>Alex K. Chen (#1 on Quora for who knows how long) – credited for connecting me with some of the most influential people I’ve met in my adult life. Likely kickstarted my path to recovery from x,y,z awful events/practices/ideologies.</li>
  <li>Chau Le Tran – A name I haven’t thought of in a long time. She connected me with Alex K. Chen, and invited me to a Facebook group chat revolving around discussion of psychedelics. She probably did this at the worst time for me to engage academically, but was nonetheless as or more important (solely on who-did-it-first basis) than Alex in connecting me with the right people.</li>
  <li>Cosmo Guerini – One of the first friends I made at my first lab position, and sent me a blog post once encouraging me to start a blog over a year ago.</li>
</ul>
