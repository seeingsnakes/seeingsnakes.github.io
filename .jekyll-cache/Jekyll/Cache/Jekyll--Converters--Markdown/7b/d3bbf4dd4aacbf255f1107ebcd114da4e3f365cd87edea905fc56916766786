I"Y<p>what is the labor of love,<br />
but the foul wind turned palatable?<br />
fermented and bubbly, funky and oozing<br />
the smell of decay becomes umami, how multi-cultural<br />
it streaks over<br />
the surface of cognition,<br />
of waking life</p>

<p>what is the labor of love,<br />
but the flow of time<br />
turned stagnant<br />
colored red and rosy in the reflection<br />
of binoclard being</p>

<p>what is the labor of love,<br />
but limbo incarnate?<br />
wherein the preachers and proselytizers<br />
beckon and reach out,<br />
declaring judgement day has come<br />
tremoring in fear and righteousness</p>

<p>what is the labor of love,<br />
but that present<br />
the Bodhisattva philosophizes<br />
that which frees in asymptotic rush<br />
truly, truly it must be</p>

<p>truly, i must think more on the matter<br />
but time,<br />
time<br />
time i do not have</p>

<p>for labor without love<br />
is labor extracted<br />
compacted and distilled,<br />
hollowed metal turned Capital,<br />
its glory filled with heretics<br />
painted targets of sacrifice<br />
and encrypted messaging</p>

<p>time<br />
time<br />
time to breathe<br />
to bake bread<br />
but slave master calls again<br />
time<br />
time to paint, and sing,<br />
re-enact Eleusinian mysteries<br />
time to make dust the president<br />
of the student loans company</p>
