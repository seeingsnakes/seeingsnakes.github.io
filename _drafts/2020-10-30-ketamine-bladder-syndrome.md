Though I've been personally excited by the new research into ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, for the treatment of depression, I've been quite surprised by the lack of discourse about its sinister side. I don't mean its sibling PCP's (impressive) ability to induce psychosis, but rather ketamine bladder syndrome, which has also been referred to as ketamine-induced interstitial cystitis.
